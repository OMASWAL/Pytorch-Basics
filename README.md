# Iris Flower Classification with PyTorch</br>

This project is a basic implementation of a neural network using PyTorch to classify whether a given flower is one of the species in the Iris dataset. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 </br>
features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and 3 species to classify: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
